  arguments from the current repository's log or diff buffer,
  respectively.  When no log or diff buffer exists for the current
  repository, these popups use the default value of
  ~magit-log-arguments~ or ~magit-diff-arguments~.

  When ~current~, log and diff popups will only reuse the arguments if
  the current buffer is derived from ~magit-log-mode~ or
  ~magit-diff-mode~, respectively.

  When ~nil~, the default value of ~magit-log-arguments~ or
  ~magit-diff-arguments~ is always used.

** Completion, Confirmation and the Selection
*** Action Confirmation

By default many actions that could potentially lead to data loss have
to be confirmed.  This includes many very common actions, so this can
quickly become annoying.  Many of these actions can be undone and if
you have thought about how to undo certain mistakes, then it should
be safe to disable confirmation for the respective actions.

The option ~magit-no-confirm~ can be used to tell Magit to perform
certain actions without the user having to confirm them.  Note that
while this option can only be used to disable confirmation for a
specific set of actions, the next section explains another way of
telling Magit to ask fewer questions.

- User Option: magit-no-confirm

  The value of this option is a list of symbols, representing actions
  that do not have to be confirmed by the user before being carried
  out.

  By default many potentially dangerous commands ask the user for
  confirmation.  Each of the below symbols stands for an action which,
  when invoked unintentionally or without being fully aware of the
  consequences, could lead to tears.  In many cases there are several
  commands that perform variations of a certain action, so we don't
  use the command names but more generic symbols.

  - Applying changes:

    - ~discard~ Discarding one or more changes (i.e. hunks or the
      complete diff for a file) loses that change, obviously.

    - ~reverse~ Reverting one or more changes can usually be undone by
      reverting the reversion.

    - ~stage-all-changes~, ~unstage-all-changes~ When there are both
      staged and unstaged changes, then un-/staging everything would
      destroy that distinction.  Of course that also applies when
      un-/staging a single change, but then less is lost and one does
      that so often that having to confirm every time would be
      unacceptable.

  - Files:

    - ~delete~ When a file that isn't yet tracked by Git is deleted,
      then it is completely lost, not just the last changes.  Very
      dangerous.

    - ~trash~ Instead of deleting a file it can also be move to the
      system trash.  Obviously much less dangerous than deleting it.

      Also see option ~magit-delete-by-moving-to-trash~.

    - ~resurrect~ A deleted file can easily be resurrected by "deleting"
      the deletion, which is done using the same command that was used
      to delete the same file in the first place.

    - ~untrack~ Untracking a file can be undone by tracking it again.
 
-Many commands read a value from the user.  By default this is done
-using the built-in function ~completing-read~, but Magit can instead use
-another completion framework.
    - ~rename~ Renaming a file can easily be undone.

  - Sequences:

    - ~reset-bisect~ Aborting (known to Git as "resetting") a bisect
      operation loses all information collected so far.

    - ~abort-rebase~ Aborting a rebase throws away all already modified
      commits, but it's possible to restore those from the reflog.

    - ~abort-merge~ Aborting a merge throws away all conflict
      resolutions which have already been carried out by the user.

    - ~merge-dirty~ Merging with a dirty worktree can make it hard to go
      back to the state before the merge was initiated.

  - References:

    - ~delete-unmerged-branch~ Once a branch has been deleted, it can
      only be restored using low-level recovery tools provided by Git.
      And even then the reflog is gone.  The user always has to
      confirm the deletion of a branch by accepting the default choice
      (or selecting another branch), but when a branch has not been
      merged yet, also make sure the user is aware of that.

    - ~delete-pr-branch~ When deleting a branch that was created from a
      pull request and if no other branches still exist on that
      remote, then `magit-branch-delete' offers to delete the remote
      as well.  This should be safe because it only happens if no
      other refs exist in the remotes namespace, and you can recreate
      the remote if necessary.

    - ~drop-stashes~ Dropping a stash is dangerous because Git stores
      stashes in the reflog.  Once a stash is removed, there is no
      going back without using low-level recovery tools provided by
      Git.  When a single stash is dropped, then the user always has
      to confirm by accepting the default (or selecting another).
      This action only concerns the deletion of multiple stashes at
      once.

  - Various:

    - ~kill-process~ There seldom is a reason to kill a process.

  - Global settings:

    Instead of adding all of the above symbols to the value of this
    option, you can also set it to the atom `t', which has the same
    effect as adding all of the above symbols.  Doing that most
    certainly is a bad idea, especially because other symbols might be
    added in the future.  So even if you don't want to be asked for
    confirmation for any of these actions, you are still better of
    adding all of the respective symbols individually.

    When ~magit-wip-before-change-mode~ is enabled, then the following
    actions can be undone fairly easily: ~discard~, ~reverse~,
    ~stage-all-changes~, and ~unstage-all-changes~.  If and only if
    this mode is enabled, then ~safe-with-wip~ has the same effect as
    adding all of these symbols individually.

*** Completion and Confirmation

Many Magit commands ask the user to select from a list of possible
things to act on, while offering the most likely choice as the
default.  For many of these commands the default is the thing at
point, provided that it actually is a valid thing to act on.  For
many commands that act on a branch, the current branch serves as
the default if there is no branch at point.

These commands combine asking for confirmation and asking for a target
to act on into a single action.  The user can confirm the default
target using ~RET~ or abort using ~C-g~.  This is similar to a ~y-or-n-p~
prompt, but the keys to confirm or abort differ.

At the same time the user is also given the opportunity to select
another target, which is useful because for some commands and/or in
some situations you might want to select the action before selecting
the target by moving to it.

However you might find that for some commands you always want to use
the default target, if any, or even that you want the command to act
on the default without requiring any confirmation at all.  The option
~magit-dwim-selection~ can be used to configure certain commands to that
effect.

Note that when the region is active then many commands act on the
things that are selected using a mechanism based on the region, in
many cases after asking for confirmation.  This region-based mechanism
is called the "selection" and is described in detail in the next
section.  When a selection exists that is valid for the invoked
command, then that command never offers to act on something else, and
whether it asks for confirmation is not controlled by this option.

Also note that Magit asks for confirmation of certain actions that are
not coupled with completion (or the selection).  Such dialogs are also
not affected by this option and are described in the previous section.

- User Option: magit-dwim-selection

This option can be used to tell certain commands to use the thing
at point instead of asking the user to select a candidate to act
on, with or without confirmation.

The value has the form ~((COMMAND nil|PROMPT DEFAULT)...)~.

- COMMAND is the command that should not prompt for a choice.
  To have an effect, the command has to use the function
  ~magit-completing-read~ or a utility function which in turn uses
  that function.

- If the command uses ~magit-completing-read~ multiple times, then
  PROMPT can be used to only affect one of these uses.  PROMPT, if
  non-nil, is a regular expression that is used to match against
  the PROMPT argument passed to ~magit-completing-read~.

- DEFAULT specifies how to use the default.  If it is ~t~, then
  the DEFAULT argument passed to ~magit-completing-read~ is used
  without confirmation.  If it is ~ask~, then the user is given
  a chance to abort.  DEFAULT can also be ~nil~, in which case the
  entry has no effect.

*** The Selection

If the region is active, then many Magit commands act on the things
that are selected using a mechanism based on the region instead of one
single thing.  When the region is not active, then these commands act
on the thing at point or read a single thing to act on.  This is
described in the previous section ！ this section only covers how
multiple things are selected, how that is visualized, and how certain
commands behave when that is the case.

Magit's mechanism for selecting multiple things, or rather sections
that represent these things, is based on the Emacs region, but the
area that Magit considers to be selected is typically larger than the
region and additional restrictions apply.

Magit makes a distinction between a region that qualifies as forming a
valid Magit selection and a region that does not.  If the region does
not qualify, then it is displayed as it is in other Emacs buffers.  If
the region does qualify as a Magit selection, then the selection is
always visualized, while the region itself is only visualized if it
begins and ends on the same line.

For a region to qualify as a Magit selection, it must begin in the
heading of one section and end in the heading of a sibling section.
Note that if the end of the region is at the very beginning of section
heading (i.e. at the very beginning of a line) then that section is
considered to be *inside* the selection.

This is not consistent with how the region is normally treated in
Emacs ！ if the region ends at the beginning of a line, then that line
is outside the region.  Due to how Magit visualizes the selection, it
should be obvious that this difference exists.

Not every command acts on every valid selection.  Some commands do not
even consider the location of point, others may act on the section at
point but not support acting on the selection, and even commands that
do support the selection of course only do so if it selects things
that they can act on.

This is the main reason why the selection must include the section at
point.  Even if a selection exists, the invoked command may disregard
it, in which case it may act on the current section only.  It is much
safer to only act on the current section but not the other selected
sections than it is to act on the current section *instead* of the
selected sections.  The latter would be much more surprising and if
the current section always is part of the selection, then that cannot
happen.

- Variable: magit-keep-region-overlay

  This variable controls whether the region is visualized as usual
  even when a valid Magit selection or a hunk-internal region exists.
  See the doc-string for more information.

*** The hunk-internal region

Somewhat related to the Magit selection described in the previous
section is the hunk-internal region.

Like the selection, the hunk-internal region is based on the Emacs
region but causes that region to not be visualized as it would in
other Emacs buffers, and includes the line on which the region ends
even if it ends at the very beginning of that line.

Unlike the selection, which is based on a region that must begin in
the heading of one section and ends in the section of a sibling
section, the hunk-internal region must begin inside the *body* of a
hunk section and end in the body of the *same* section.

The hunk-internal region is honored by "apply" commands, which can,
among other targets, act on a hunk.  If the hunk-internal region is
active, then such commands act only on the marked part of the hunk
instead of on the complete hunk.

*** Support for Completion Frameworks

The built-in option ~completing-read-function~ specifies the low-level
function used by ~completing-read~ to ask a user to select from a list
of choices.  Its default value is ~completing-read-default~.
Alternative completion frameworks typically activate themselves by
substituting their own implementation.

Mostly for historic reasons Magit provides a similar option named
~magit-completing-read-function~, which only controls the low-level
function used by ~magit-completing-read~.  This option also makes it
possible to use a different completing mechanism for Magit than for
the rest of Emacs, but doing that is not recommend.

You most likely don't have to customize the magit-specific option to
use an alternative completion framework.  For example, if you enable
~ivy-mode~, then Magit will respect that, and if you enable ~helm-mode~,
then you are done too.

However if you want to use Ido, then ~ido-mode~ won't do the trick.  You
will also have to install the ~ido-completing-read+~ package and use
~magit-ido-completing-read~ as ~magit-completing-read-function~.
 
 - User Option: magit-completing-read-function
 
-  The value of this variable is the function used to perform
-  completion.  Because functions /intended/ to replace ~completing-read~
-  often are not fully compatible drop-in replacements, and also
-  because Magit expects them to add the default choice to the prompt
-  themselves, such functions should not be used directly.  Instead a
-  wrapper function has to be used.
  The value of this variable is the low-level function used to perform
  completion by code that uses ~magit-completing-read~ (as opposed to
  the built-in ~completing-read~).

  The default value, ~magit-builtin-completing-read~, is suitable for
  the standard completion mechanism, ~ivy-mode~, and ~helm-mode~ at least.
 
-Currently only the real ~completing-read~ and [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings][Ido]] are fully supported.
-More frameworks will be supported in the future.
  The built-in ~completing-read~ and ~completing-read-default~ are *not*
  suitable to be used here.  ~magit-builtin-completing-read~ performs
  some additional work, and any function used in its place has to do
  the same.
 
 - Function: magit-builtin-completing-read prompt choices &optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def
 
-  Perform completion using ~completion-read~.
  This function performs completion using the built-in ~completion-read~
  and does some additional magit-specific work.
 
 - Function: magit-ido-completing-read prompt choices &optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def
 
-  Perform completion using ~ido-completing-read+~ from the package by
-  the same name (which you have to explicitly install).  Ido itself
-  comes with a supposed drop-in replacement ~ido-completing-read~, but
-  that has too many deficits to serve our needs.
  This function performs completion using ~ido-completing-read+~ from the
  package by the same name (which you have to explicitly install) and
  does some additional magit-specific work.
 
-By default many commands that could potentially lead to data loss have
-to be confirmed.  This includes many very common commands, so this
-can become annoying quickly.  Many of these actions can be undone,
-provided ~magit-wip-before-change-mode~ is turned on (which it is not by
-default, due to performance concerns).
  We have to use ~ido-completing-read+~ instead of the
  ~ido-completing-read~ that comes with Ido itself, because the latter,
  while intended as a drop-in replacement, cannot serve that purpose
  because it violates too many of the implicit conventions.
 
-- User Option: magit-no-confirm
- Function: magit-completing-read prompt choices &optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def fallback
 
-  The value of this option is a list of symbols, representing commands
-  which do not have to be confirmed by the user before being carried
-  out.
  This is the function that Magit commands use when they need the user
  to select a single thing to act on.  The arguments have the same
  meaning as for ~completing-read~, except for FALLBACK, which is unique
  to this function and is described below.
 
-  When the global mode ~magit-wip-before-change-mode~ is enabled then
-  many commands can be undone.  If that mode is enabled then adding
-  ~safe-with-wip~ to this list has the same effect as adding ~discard~,
-  ~reverse~, ~stage-all-changes~, and ~unstage-all-changes~.
  Instead of asking the user to choose from a list of possible
  candidates, this function may just return the default specified by
  DEF, with or without requiring user confirmation.  Whether that is
  the case depends on PROMPT, ~this-command~ and ~magit-dwim-selection~.

  - FALLBACK specifies a secondary default that is only used if the
    primary default DEF is ~nil~.  The secondary default is not subject
    to ~magit-dwim-selection~ ！ if DEF is ~nil~ but FALLBACK is not, then
    this function always asks the user to choose a candidate, just as
    if both defaults were ~nil~.

*** Additional Completion Options

- User Option: magit-list-refs-sortby

  For many commands that read a ref or refs from the user, the value
  of this option can be used to control the order of the refs.  Valid
  values include any key accepted by the ~--sort~ flag of ~git
  for-each-ref~.  By default, refs are sorted alphabetically by their
  full name (e.g., "refs/heads/master").
 
 ** Running Git

When Git is run for side-effects, the process output is logged in a
per-repository log buffer, which can be consulted using the
~magit-process~ command when things don't go as expected.

The output/errors for up to `magit-process-log-max' Git commands are
retained.

   just negatively affects performance.
 
*** Git Process Status

When a Git process is running for side-effects, Magit displays an
indicator in the mode line, using the ~magit-mode-line-process~ face.

If the Git process exits successfully, the process indicator is
removed from the mode line immediately.

In the case of a Git error, the process indicator is not removed, but
is instead highlighted with the ~magit-mode-line-process-error~ face,
and the error details from the process buffer are provided as a
tooltip for mouse users.  This error indicator persists in the mode
line until the next magit buffer refresh.

If you do not wish process errors to be indicated in the mode line,
customize the ~magit-process-display-mode-line-error~ user option.

Process errors are additionally indicated at the top of the status
buffer.

Magit displays references in logs a bit differently from how Git does
it.

Local branches are blue and remote branches are green.  Of course that
depends on the used theme, as do the colors used for other types of
references.  The current branch has a box around it, as do remote
branches that are their respective remote's ~HEAD~ branch.

If a local branch and its push-target point at the same commit, then
their names are combined to preserve space and to make that
relationship visible.  For example:

The diffs shown in the revision buffer may be automatically restricted
to a subset of the changed files.  If the revision buffer is displayed
from a log buffer, the revision buffer will share the same file
restriction as that log buffer (also see the command
~magit-diff-toggle-file-filter~).  Note, however, that the log's file
restriction will be ignored when ~magit-log-arguments~ includes
~--follow~.  In this case, the ~-u~ argument of the log popup can be
used to show the file-restricted diffs inline.

If the revision buffer is not displayed from a log buffer, the file
restriction is determined by the file restriction in the repository's
diff buffer, if it exists, and the value of the option
~magit-use-sticky-arguments~.

- Key: b R, magit-branch-pull-request

  This command creates and configures a new branch from a Github
  pull-request, creating and configuring a new remote if necessary.

  The name of the local branch is the same as the name of the remote
  branch that you are being asked to merge, unless the contributor
  could not be bother to properly name the branch before opening the
  pull-request.  The most likely such case is when you are being asked
  to merge something like "fork/master" into "origin/master".  In such
  cases the local branch will be named "pr-N", where ~N~ is the
  pull-request number.

  These variables are always set by this command:

  - ~branch.<name>.pullRequest~ is set to the pull-request number.
  - ~branch.<name>.description~ is set to the pull-request title.
  - ~branch.<name>.rebase~ is set to ~true~ because there should be no
    merge commits among the commits in a pull-request.

  This command also configures the upstream and the push-remote of the
  local branch that it creates.

  The branch against which the pull-request was opened, is always used
  as the upstream.  This makes it easy to see what commits you are
  being asked to merge in the section titled something like "Unmerged
  into origin/master".

  Like for other commands that create a branch it depends on the
  option ~magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream~ whether the remote branch
  itself or the respective local branch is used as the upstream, so
  this section may also be titled e.g. "Unmerged into master".

  When necessary and possible, then the remote pull-request branch is
  configured to be used as the push-target.  This makes it easy to see
  what further changes the contributor has made since you last
  reviewed their changes in the section titled something like
  "Unpulled from origin/new-feature" or "Unpulled from
  fork/new-feature".

  - If the pull-request branch is located in the upstream repository,
    then it is not necessary to configure the push-target.

    (If you have push access to the upstream repository, then it is
    usually a good idea to configure that as the push-remote using
    ~remote.pushDefault~.  However even if you are not using that
    recommended setting, then it is still easy enough to set
    ~branch.<name>.pushRemote~ while pushing using ~P p~.)

  - If the pull-request branch is located inside a fork, then you
    usually are able to push to that branch, because Github by default
    allows the recipient of a pull-request to push to the remote
    pull-request branch even if it is located in a fork.  The
    contributor has to explicitly disable this.

    - If you are not allowed to push to the pull-request branch on
      the fork, then a branch by the same name located in the
      upstream repository is configured as the push-target.

    - A ！ sadly rather common ！ special case is when the contributor
      didn't bother to use a dedicated branch for the pull-request.

      The most likely such case is when you are being asked to merge
      something like "fork/master" into "origin/master".  The special
      push permission mentioned above is never granted for the branch
      that is the repository's default branch, and that is almost
      certainly be the case in this scenario.

      To enable you to easily push somewhere anyway, the local branch
      is named "pr-N" (where ~N~ is the pull-request number) and the
      upstream repository is used as the push-remote.

    - Finally, if you are allowed to push to the pull-request branch
      and the contributor had the foresight to use a dedicated branch,
      then the fork is configured as the push-remote.

    The push-remote is configured using ~branch.<name>.pushRemote~, even
    if the used value is identical to that of ~remote.pushDefault~, just
    in case you change the value of the latter later on.  Additionally
    the variable ~branch.<name>.pullRequestRemote~ is set to the fork
    remote.

  When you later delete the local pull-request branch, then you are
  offered to also delete the corresponding remote, provided it is not
  the upstream remote and that the tracking branch that corresponds to
  the deleted branch is the only remaining tracked branch.  If you
  don't confirm, then only the tracking branch itself is deleted in
  addition to the local branch.

  Do not delete the tracking branch instead of the local branch.  The
  cleanup mentioned in the previous paragraph is not performed if you
  do that.

      you reset ~HEAD~ to an earlier commit, and that there are some
      staged and/or unstaged changes (likely, but not necessarily)
      originating from that commit.  However it is no longer possible
      to create a new commit with the same tree or at least the same
      patch-id because you have already made other changes.

  - When a commit is prefixed with ~poof~ or ~gone~, then that indicates
    that rebase applied that commit but that you then reset ~HEAD~ to an
    earlier commit (likely to split it up into multiple commits), and
    that there are no uncommitted changes.

    - When a commit is prefixed with ~poof~, then that indicates that it
      is no longer reachable from ~HEAD~, but that it has been replaced
      with one or more commits, which together have the exact same
      effect.

    - When a commit is prefixed with ~gone~, then that indicates that it
      is no longer reachable from ~HEAD~ and that we also cannot
      determine whether its changes are still in effect in one or more
      new commits.  They might be, but if so, then there must also be
      other changes which makes it impossible to know for sure.

**** MacOS Performance

On macOS Emacs currently creates child processes using ~fork~.  It
appears that this also copies GUI resources.  The result is that
forking takes about 30 times as long on Darwin than on Linux.  And
because Magit starts many ~git~ processes even when doing simple things,
that makes quite a difference.

On the ~master~ branch Emacs now uses ~vfork~ when possible, like this was
already done on Linux, and now child creation only takes about twice
as long on Darwin.  See [fn:mac1] for more information.

Nobody knows when the changes on the ~master~ branch will be released as
~26.1~, but it is still a long way off.  You might want to get your
hands on this change before then.  The easiest way to get a patched
Emacs is to install the ~emacs-plus~ formula [fn:mac2] using ~homebrew~.
The change has been backported, so you get it not only when using
~--HEAD~, but also when using ~--devel~ or when installing the latest
release (by not using a version argument).

Alternatively you can apply the backport [fn:mac3] manually.

*** A branch and tag sharing the same name breaks SOMETHING

Or more generally, ambiguous refnames break SOMETHING.

Magit assumes that refs are named non-ambiguously across the
"refs/heads/", "refs/tags/", and "refs/remotes/" namespaces (i.e., all
the names remain unique when those prefixes are stripped).  We
consider ambiguous refnames unsupported and recommend that you use a
non-ambiguous naming scheme.  However, if you do work with a
repository that has ambiguous refnames, please report any issues you
encounter so that we can investigate whether there is a simple fix.

* Debugging Tools

Magit and its dependencies provide a few debugging tools, and we
appreciate it very much if you use those tools before reporting an
issue.  Please include all relevant output when reporting an
issue.

- Key: M-x magit-version, magit-version

  This command shows the currently used versions of Magit, Git, and
  Emacs in the echo area.  Non-interactively this just returns the
  Magit version.

- Key: M-x magit-emacs-Q-command, magit-emacs-Q-command

  This command shows a debugging shell command in the echo area and
  adds it to the kill ring.  Paste that command into a shell an run
  it.

  This shell command starts ~emacs~ with only ~magit~ and its
  dependencies loaded.  Neither your configuration nor other installed
  packages are loaded.  This makes it easier to determine whether some
  issue lays with Magit or something else.

- Key: M-x magit-debug-git-executable, magit-debug-git-executable

  This command displays a buffer containing information about the
  available and used ~git~ executable(s), and can be useful when
  investigating ~exec-path~ issues.

  Also see [[*Git Executable]].

- Key: M-x with-editor-debug, with-editor-debug

  This command displays a buffer containing information about the
  available and used ~git~ executable(s), and can be useful when
  investigating why Magit (or rather ~with-editor~) cannot find an
  appropriate ~emacsclient~ executable.

  Also see [[info:with-editor#Debugging]].
