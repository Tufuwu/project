-StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
-(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
-operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
-as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
-other repositories using standard GIT functionality.
Stacked Git, StGit for short, is an application for managing Git commits as
a stack of patches.
 
-Note that StGIT is not an SCM interface on top of GIT and it expects a
-previously initialised GIT repository (unless it is cloned using StGIT
-directly). For standard SCM operations, either use plain GIT commands
-or the Cogito tool but it is not recommended to mix them with the
-StGIT commands.
With a patch stack workflow, multiple patches can be developed concurrently and
efficiently, with each patch focused on a single concern, resulting in both
a clean Git commit history and improved productivity.
